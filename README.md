## Inspiration
Sleeping _during_ your vacation days?? This is **not** how you want to spend your week away from work! Jet lag is a common problem from those longgg international flights that travelers encounter. But this can easily be preventable with **ZeroLag**!  

## Why ZeroLag?
For each person, a flight experience is different with sleep and schedules, making _general_ advice not so helpful. ZeroLag is a personal app that takes into account a user's sleep schedule, travel itinerary, and personal prefernces in order to beat jet lag before it happens. Additionally, it reminds you to stay hydrated during your trip since it is quite easy to get dehydrated while traveling! In the end, the user's travel will be much better, enjoyable, and stress-free!
